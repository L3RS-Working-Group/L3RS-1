# Security Model

L3RS-1 assumes:

- Honest majority consensus at underlying ledger layer.
- Cryptographic hash functions are collision-resistant.
- Deterministic serialization is faithfully implemented.

L3RS-1 does NOT assume:

- Economic price stability.
- Legal enforceability guarantees.
- Protection against private key compromise.

Security properties derive from invariant preservation and canonical binding.
