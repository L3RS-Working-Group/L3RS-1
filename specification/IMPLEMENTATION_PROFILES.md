# Implementation Profiles

L3RS-1 is ledger-agnostic.

Profiles define how L3RS-1 binds to specific execution environments.

## Ethereum Profile (Planned)
- CID storage mapping
- Compliance enforcement layer
- Governance hash anchoring

## Solana Profile (Planned)
- Program-derived address binding
- State compression compatibility

## Canton Profile (Planned)
- Contract key binding
- Domain governance anchoring

Profiles SHALL preserve all protocol invariants.
